                <p>The Housing Choice Voucher (Section 8) program is SCCHA’s largest rental assistance program with about 17,000 participants. The “housing choice voucher” is a 100% federally funded rental subsidy for low-income households living in privately owned rental units. SCCHA voucher holders in the Moving to Work (MTW) program pay 32% of their gross income toward rent (or a minimum rent of $50, whichever is higher), and the agency pays the balance of the rent directly to the landlords on behalf of the families.</p>

                <h3>Safe Parking</h3>
                <p>
                    The City of San José provides opportunities for homeless families and individuals living in cars and RVs to park in safe places overnight. More than 1,000 people sleep in vehicles on any given night in San José. <br /> <br />

                    The City has created two types of Safe Parking programs. <br /><br />

                    The first is a City-operated program at two locations. Individuals and families interested in participating in this program should contact LifeMoves at 669-238-6193 or safeparking@lifemoves.org. <br /> <br />

                    The second is an ordinance that allows businesses and non-profits to establish Safe Parking Areas in their parking lots. Any organization interested in creating a Safe Parking Area should contact Lorena Diez in the City’s Housing Department at (408) 975-4456 or lorena.diez@sanjoseca.gov. The process for getting started includes a simple and FREE registration and inspection of the proposed parking lot.
